# Pixie

## Intro

Pixie is a programming language designed to function as both a general purpose programming language, as well as an interpreter
for use in scripting. The code is still in a "pre-alpha" phase and as such changes fairly quickly. Pixie is a lisp that is highly
inspired by Clojure, and other functional programming languages. It is written in RPython (http://pypy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/coding-guide.html) and
as such supports a fairly fast GC and a tracing JIT.

## Features

Some planned and implemented features:

* Protocols first implementation
* Delimited continuations (implemented, debugging in progress)
* A "good enough" JIT (implemented, tuning still a WIP)
* Easy FFI (TODO)
* Pattern matching (TODO)

## Contributing

Currently there isn't a whole lot that newcomers can help out with, since the entire codebase is in quite a bit of flux. However, we do want to
have a very open contribution process. If you have a feature you'd like to implement, submit a PR or file an issue and we'll see what we can do.
